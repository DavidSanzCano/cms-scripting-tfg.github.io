# Executive Summary

The project involves creating a website using `Drupal`  that serves as a repository for `PowerShell` scripts for automating processes for the deployment of a network with **domain controller**, **DNS server**, and **Active Directory**. The website will allow registered users to upload, download, and share `PowerShell` scripts for automating configuration and network administration tasks.

The main objective of the project is to provide system administrators with a tool that allows them quick access to a wide variety of useful `PowerShell` scripts for automating processes for the deployment of a network with **domain controller**, **DNS server**, and **Active Directory** using `Drupal` as the CMS. The website will also promote collaboration among users by allowing them to share their own scripts and comment on and evaluate scripts from other users.

The project will be developed using the `Drupal` CMS, which is an open-source web content management system that offers great flexibility and scalability. The website will be hosted on a web server and integrated with a database management system for storing and organizing `PowerShell` scripts.

It is expected that the project will have a positive impact on the efficiency and productivity of system administrators by providing them with access to a wide variety of `PowerShell` scripts for automating processes. The website will also promote collaboration and knowledge-sharing among users, which will contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of network administration processes.
